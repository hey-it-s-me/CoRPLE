    y = sefilter2(x, f1, f2, [extmod], [shift])

    Input:
    x:      input image
    f1, f2: 1-D filters in each dimension that make up a 2D seperable filter
    extmod: [optional] extension mode (default is 'per')
    shift:  [optional] specify the window over which the
    convolution occurs. By default shift = [0; 0].

    Output:
    y:      filtered image of the same size as the input image:
    Y(z1,z2) = X(z1,z2)*F1(z1)*F2(z2)*z1^shift(1)*z2^shift(2)

    Note:
    The origin of the filter f is assumed to be floor(size(f)/2) + 1.
    Amount of shift should be no more than floor((size(f)-1)/2).
   The output image has the same size with the input image.
