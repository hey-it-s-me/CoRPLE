    Input:
    x:	input image
    h0, h1:	two decomposition 2D filters
    type1:	'q', 'p' or 'pq' for selecting quincunx or parallelogram
    downsampling matrix
    type2:	second parameter for selecting the filterbank type
    If type1 == 'q' then type2 is one of {'1r', '1c', '2r', '2c'}
    If type1 == 'p' then type2 is one of {0, 1, 2, 3}
    Those are specified in QDOWN and PDOWN
    If type1 == 'pq' then same as 'p' except that
    the paralellogram matrix is replaced by a combination
    of a  resampling and a quincunx matrices
    extmod:	[optional] extension mode (default is 'per')

    Output:
    y0, y1:	two result subband images
