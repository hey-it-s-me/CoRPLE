    Input:
    x:	input image
    f:	filter in the ladder network structure
    type1:	'q' or 'p' for selecting quincunx or parallelogram
    downsampling matrix
    type2:	second parameter for selecting the filterbank type
    If type1 == 'q' then type2 is one of {'1r', '1c', '2r', '2c'}
    ({1, 2, 0, 3} can also be used as equivalent)
    If type1 == 'p' then type2 is one of {0, 1, 2, 3}
    Those are specified in QPDEC and PPDEC
    extmod:	[optional] extension mode (default is 'per')
    This refers to polyphase components.

    Output:
    y0, y1:	two result subband images

    Note:		This is also called the lifting scheme
