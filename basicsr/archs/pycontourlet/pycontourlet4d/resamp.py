        y = resamp(x, type, [shift, extmod])

        Input:
        x:	input image
        type: one of {0,1,2,3} (see note)

        shift:	[optional] amount of shift (default is 1)
        extmod: [optional] extension mode (default is 'per').
        Other options are:

        Output:
        y:	resampled image.

        Note:
        The resampling matrices are:
                R1 = [1, 1;  0, 1];
                R2 = [1, -1; 0, 1];
                R3 = [1, 0;  1, 1];
                R4 = [1, 0; -1, 1];

        For type 1 and type 2, the input image is extended (for example
        periodically) along the vertical direction;
        while for type 3 and type 4 the image is extended along the
        horizontal direction.

        Calling resamp(x, type, n) which n is positive integer is equivalent
        to repeatly calling resamp(x, type) n times.

        Input shift can be negative so that resamp(x, 1, -1) is the same
        with resamp(x, 2, 1)"""

    else:
