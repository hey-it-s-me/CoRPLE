    % Input:
    %   x:      input image
    %   pfilt:  filter name for the pyramidal decomposition step
    %   dfilt:  filter name for the directional decomposition step
    %   nlevs:  vector of numbers of directional filter bank decomposition levels
    %           at each pyramidal level (from coarse to fine scale).
    %           If the number of level is 0, a critically sampled 2-D wavelet
    %           decomposition step is performed.
    %
    % Output:
    %   y:      a cell vector of length length(nlevs) + 1, where except y{1} is
    %           the lowpass subband, each cell corresponds to one pyramidal
    %           level and is a cell vector that contains bandpass directional
    %           subbands from the DFB at that level.
    %
    % Index convention:
    %   Suppose that nlevs = [l_J,...,l_2, l_1], and l_j >= 2.
    %   Then for j = 1,...,J and k = 1,...,2^l_j
    %       y{J+2-j}{k}(n_1, n_2)
    %   is a contourlet coefficient at scale 2^j, direction k, and position
    %       (n_1 * 2^(j+l_j-2), n_2 * 2^j) for k <= 2^(l_j-1),
    %       (n_1 * 2^j, n_2 * 2^(j+l_j-2)) for k > 2^(l_j-1).
    %   As k increases from 1 to 2^l_j, direction k rotates clockwise from
    %   the angle 135 degree with uniform increment in cotan, from -1 to 1 for
    %   k <= 2^(l_j-1), and then uniform decrement in tan, from 1 to -1 for
    %   k > 2^(l_j-1).
