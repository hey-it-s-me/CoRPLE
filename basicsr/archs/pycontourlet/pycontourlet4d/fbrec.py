    Input:
    y0, y1:	two input subband images
    h0, h1:	two reconstruction 2D filters
    type1:	'q', 'p' or 'pq' for selecting quincunx or parallelogram
    upsampling matrix
    type2:	second parameter for selecting the filterbank type
    If type1 == 'q' then type2 is one of {'1r', '1c', '2r', '2c'}
    If type1 == 'p' then type2 is one of {0, 1, 2, 3}
    Those are specified in QUP and PUP
    If type1 == 'pq' then same as 'p' except that
    the paralellogram matrix is replaced by a combination
    of a quincunx and a resampling matrices
    extmod:	[optional] extension mode (default is 'per')

    Output:
    x:	reconstructed image

    Note:	This is the general case of 2D two-channel filterbank
