     Input:
        x:	input image
        type:	one of {1, 2, 3, 4} for selecting sampling matrices:
                        P1 = [2, 0; 1, 1]
                        P2 = [2, 0; -1, 1]

                        P4 = [1, -1; 0, 2]
        phase:	[optional] 0 or 1 to specify the phase of the input image as
                zero- or one-polyphase	component, (default is 0)

     Output:
