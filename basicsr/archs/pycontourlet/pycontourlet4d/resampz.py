        Input:
        x:      input matrix
        type:   one of {0, 1, 2, 3} (see note)

        Note:
        The resampling matrices are:
                R1 = [1, 1;  0, 1];
                R2 = [1, -1; 0, 1];

                R4 = [1, 0; -1, 1];

        This resampling program does NOT involve periodicity, thus it
        zero-pad and extend the matrix."""
